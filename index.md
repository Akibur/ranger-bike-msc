## Documentation for Bike Ecommerce site

# Overview

The bike eCommerce store is an eCommerce platform merchants can use to display and sell their bikes online. They will be able to upload information about their bikes and customers will be able to buy the bikes using the platform.
The E-commerce store will have two user classes

- Customers
- Admin

The customer will be able to browse through the different bikes, login/register and order a bike that he likes
The admin will be able to login, manage the different product information, view and manage the orders and create other admins accounts.

The system will allow users to quickly and easily view the technical specifications of each bike and make a purchase from the comforts of their homes. They don’t need to go to a showroom to view and buy the bikes. This saves the customer time and at the same time, the platform’s owner can serve their customers 24/7.
The Ecommerce platform will have a backend API and a React-based frontend which will consume the API and provide the functionality to the software. A no SQL database called mongoDB will be used as the database.
